# Database Skill – Create Tables, Migrations, Schema Design

## Instructions

1. **Schema Design**

   * Identify entities and relationships
   * Define primary and foreign keys
   * Normalize tables (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
   * Plan indexes for performance

2. **Creating Tables**

   * Use `CREATE TABLE` statements
   * Specify column types and constraints (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `DEFAULT`)
   * Include primary and foreign keys
   * Add indexes where necessary

3. **Migrations**

   * Use migration tools (e.g., Rails ActiveRecord, Django ORM, Alembic)
   * Generate migration files for schema changes
   * Apply migrations to update database structure
   * Rollback migrations safely when needed

4. **Best Practices**

   * Use meaningful table and column names
   * Keep tables normalized but avoid over-normalization
   * Document relationships and constraints
   * Test migrations in a development environment before production
   * Version-control migration files
