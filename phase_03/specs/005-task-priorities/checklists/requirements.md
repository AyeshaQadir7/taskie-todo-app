# Specification Quality Checklist: Task Priorities

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-17
**Feature**: [specs/005-task-priorities/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ✅ All checklist items pass - specification is complete and ready for planning
- ✅ 5 user stories with clear priority levels (P1, P2)
- ✅ 18 functional requirements with specific, testable criteria
- ✅ 15 success criteria with measurable outcomes
- ✅ Edge cases thoroughly documented
- ✅ Dependencies on existing specs (001, 002, 003, 004) clearly identified
- ✅ Backward compatibility considerations included
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Sign-Off

Specification is **READY FOR PLANNING** phase. Proceed with `/sp.plan` when ready to create implementation plan.
