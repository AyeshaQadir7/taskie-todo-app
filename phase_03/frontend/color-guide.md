# Color Guide

### **#f5f5f5 — “Paper White”**

**Role: Primary / Base color**

This is your app’s personality. It feels focused, calm, and professional.

Use it for:

- App background (main surfaces)
- Sidebar / navigation

This should cover ~60–70% of what the user sees.

### **#c68dff — “Focus Violet”**

**Role: Primary accent**

This is your “action & intention” color — it feels creative and energetic without being aggressive.

Use it for:

- Primary buttons (Add Task, Save, New List)
- Active states (selected tab, active filter)
- Links
- Progress bars
- Highlights on important UI elements

This is what draws the eye first.

This color screams progress, completion, and positive feedback.

Use it for:

It should feel like a reward.

### **#323843 — “Midnight Slate”**

**Role: Content & contrast**

This keeps everything readable and clean against your light base.

Use it for:

- Primary text
- Task titles
- Input fields
- Card surfaces (optional)
- Icons on light backgrounds

This gives breathing room and keeps the UI from feeling heavy.

## Visual hierarchy (important)

If everything is colorful, nothing feels important.
So use them like this:

- **Slate (323843)** → information
- **White (f5f5f5)** → background and structure
- **Violet (c68dff)** → actions
- **Lime (cbe857)** → results

This makes your app feel fast, calm, and rewarding — perfect for productivity.

I want the UI to be simple yet looks modern and aesthetically pleasing and choose a unique font that will good with UI. 

the site should have max 4-5 sections:
1. Hero Section (The hook)
Purpose: Make them feel relief instantly.

2. The Problem → Your Promise 
Purpose: Build emotional connection.

3. How It Works
Purpose: Remove fear of complexity.

5. Final Call to Action
Purpose: Get them to act.
